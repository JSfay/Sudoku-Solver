# Sudoku-Solver

This project is about a Sudoku Solver

  Main.java runs the program 
  
  Constraint.java is about the rules of Sudoku
    1. There cannot be same numbers appear in one row/column/box
    2. This file also creates the board
    
  Coordinate.java basiclly provides the setters and getters of the x, y coordinate of the numbers in the board
  
  Input.java asks the users to provide valid inputs
    1. Input cannot be anything else than numbers 
    2. Users have to enter a whole role each time so the program will throw an exception if they enter anything else
    3. Use "0" for blanks
    4. Numbers that user entered have to follow the rule of Sudoku
    
  Run.java is the algorithm
